# Yi Plus script

## Install:
The files (autoexec.ash, yiplus directory) need to be placed in the root directory of your camera's micro sd card.

## Setup:
Modes, settings, and LED blinking behavior can be modified by editing yi_plus.json.  
In directory json_scripts you will find predefined json commands. You need to replace file yi_plus.json in the yi_plus directory
to switch the script.

## Using:
Single click power button:  
Normal behavior - switch between capture and record  
Double click power button (press two times within .5 seconds):  
If in capture mode, goes to next yi_plus capture mode listed in yi_plus.json  
If in record mode, goes to next yi_plus record mode listed in yi_plus.json  
Note: Yi Plus also works with the bluetooth remote!  

## Known Issues:
- sometimes doesn't work. need to turn camera off and back on. maybe an issue with the wifi trick?  
- wifi LED blinks but but wifi is not on  
- pressing wifi button will turn wifi off and yi_plus will stop working  
- pressing wifi button again will turn wifi on and allow connection from phone/tablet  
- must power cycle camera after using wifi  
- might not be able to upgrade firmware while yi_plus is running (might have to switch to a different sd card)
