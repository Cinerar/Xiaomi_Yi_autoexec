## ABOUT

* Bitrate of up to 35MB/s 
* Files now have a maximum of 4GB instead of 2GB. 
* GoPro Superview like stretching (very wide FOV, nice for fpv quads) 
* Sharpness Increase 
* Deletes annoying ".thm" files automatically on startup 
* 2 second beep confirms the script is loaded 

NEW in V8:  

* More detail in shadows/highlights 
* GoPro Protune "Flat" colour option 
* Night mode 

## KNOWN ISSUES:  

Superview will sometimes cause the camera to cut off or split footage if the card is too slow or bitrate too high.
Manual Superview may not work on 22L cameras, Auto is fine. The script may cause the camera's time and date settings to change. This can be easily changed back to normal in the app.

Day is optimised for day time use and up to late sunset. After that it will become more grainy.

Night is for people who want to use the script at night or under indoor lighting.
It will work in daytime too, just slightly blurrier than the daytime one.
I have not included superview on night so you can use 30fps modes (better for night time)
