## Creates file with your credentials every boot of camera

### What the hell is that?  

If you will lost your cam during your activity and someone will find it, camera will serve him you data (name, address, telephone number) whatever you like to message to him.
Even after **formatting SD card** your data will be still recreated!

### How to get it work?

1. Copy all files to your SD card root (autoexec.ash, new_autoexec.txt, IF_FOUND.txt)
2. Edit file IF_FOUND.txt and place your credentials
3. Boot up your camera
4. After you hear long beep from camera, you are done!

Now every time if you will boot your camera file IF_FOUND.txt will be created.  
You dont need to delete autoexec.ash or other files from your camera, script will do it for you.

Thanks to KonradIT for the idea!
