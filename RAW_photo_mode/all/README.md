**Postprocessing:**

I attached the utility RAW2DNG for postprocessing, configured by nutsey.
Just drag your RAW files in there, set it to Xiaomi Yi format and convert.

Now, drag the converted DNG files onto the Yi-correct-RAW.bat.
It will automatically adjust your DNGs to look correct.

You can now edit the files in Photoshop/Lightroom/etc.
I also included my own Yi Lightroom/Camera Raw Lens Profile,
which you may use to remove the fisheye effect and vignetting from your RAW pictures.
It is not perfect, play around with amount of correction of vignette and distortion.
It goes here:
C:\Users\[YOU]\AppData\Roaming\Adobe\CameraRaw\LensProfiles\1.0


NEW Version with counter for Correction Script.
